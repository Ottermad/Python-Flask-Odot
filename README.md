ODOT
====

This project is based on the Build A Todo List Application with Rails 4 from [Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com). 
It takes the simple Ruby on Rails Application which allows you to create and manage todo lists and recreates it using the Flask
framework and Python language. It features all the CRUD operations and a bootstrapped frontend.

Features
--------
* Built in Python and Flask
* Uses the [peewee ORM](https://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to manage a MySQL database
* Uses [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) to provide a better looking frontend


A demo will **hopefully** go live soon.
